# Tkinter Energy Control Interface (FIU)

This project is a desktop graphical user interface (GUI) built with Python and Tkinter to support energy monitoring, control, and experimentation for FIU's Energy Lab.

## Features

- Visual interface for running and monitoring energy-related experiments
- Controls for starting/stopping experiments and adjusting key parameters
- Live feedback and status information for easier lab operation

## Requirements

- Python 3.9+ (recommended)
- Tkinter (usually included with standard Python installations)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aapin1/Tkinter-Energy-Control-Interface-FIU-.git
   cd Tkinter-Energy-Control-Interface-FIU-
   ```

2. Run the main GUI script (update the filename if needed):
   ```bash
   python energy_gui.py
   ```

## Repository Structure

- `energy_gui.py` – Main Tkinter interface for the energy control system
- `energy.py` – Core logic or utilities used by the GUI (e.g., energy calculations, device interfaces)
- `fake1.py`, `fake2.py`, `fake3.py` – Helper/test scripts or placeholders used during development
- `README.md` – Project documentation (this file)
